# Computer Music: 1 Fundamentals of Computer Music

### Initial Questions

**What are the fundamentals of Computer music?**


**How are the fundamentals of Computer music useful to me as a composer and as a programmer?**

## 1.4 The Use of a Computer in Audio Systems

### Initial Questions

**What qualifies as an audio system?**


**What roles can a computer take in audio systems?**


**How does a user interact with a computer in an audio system?**

### Notes

- audio is stored digitally by recording the numeric values that represent the
  voltage in the audio signal

- In turn, voltage in the audio signal represents pressure in the audio wave

- I/O devices convert signal between Digital and Analog (D/A vs A/D)

- Low-pass filters are necessary before converting A/D and after converting
  D/A to prevent unwanted components in the sound (discussed in chpt 3)

- Uses of computer in audio system:
  - **Digital Recording:** recording an analog signal into digital signal
  - **Digital Playback:** reading digital signal into audio signal
  - **Signal Processing:** modifies digital signal before sending it somewhere
  - **Signal Analyzer:** determine characteristics of an audio signal
  - **Digital Synthesis:** generating a digital audio signal

### Consequent Questions

**What are some interesting ways a signal can be processed?**

**What characteristics might be useful to analyze from an audio signal?**
