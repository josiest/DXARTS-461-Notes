# Computer Music: 2 The Acoustics and Psychoacoustics of Music

### Initial Questions
**What is the difference betwen Acoustics and Psychoacoustics**
- Acoustics model the pysical attributes of sound. Psychoacoustics model the
  human perception of sound

## 2.1 Sound and the Ear

### Initial Questions
**How does our ear turn pressure waves into perceived sound?**
- The surface of our ear drum vibrates from the sound wave hitting it.
- It passes these vibrations onto the cochlea which is filled with fluid and has
  an organ in it called the basilar membrane.
- The basilar membrane has hairs with nerves that send signals to our brain at
  the frequency of the sound.
- Loudness is determined by the intensity of the acoustic energy.

**How does our ear differ from an analog or digital recording device?**
- Microphones aren't discussed in this section, but if I remember correctly,
  the part in a microphone which vibrates in response to an acoustic wave is
  magnetic.
- The disturbances on the magnetic surface generate an electric wave in tandem
  with the magnetic field displacement (a la electromagnetism)
- So a microphone differs from an ear in the physical/biological means of how it
  transforms acoustic energy into electric energy
- Namely a microphone uses a magnetic surface while an ear uses a multi-organ
  process including organ surfaces, bones, fluids, hairs and nerves

### Notes
**Limitations of Human Hearing**
- Human hearing ranges approx. from 20 Hz to 20 kHz
- Threshold of audibility ranges from 0.00002 N/m^2 to 200 N/m^2

**Acoustic Properties and their Psychoacoustic "Analogs"**
- Frequency -> Pitch
- Amplitude -> Loudness

While the psychoacoustic "analogs" correlate to their acoustic counterparts.
Other factors may change how they are percieved. Consider for example, the
Doppler effect.

- **Intensity** is a measure of power in a sound that contacts the ear drum.
  Proportional to the square of amplitude and measured in Watts per sq. meter

- Intensity is percieved logarithmically - i.e. percieved based on the ratio
  between two values

- The **decibel** (dB) is a relative unit of measurement of ratio between two
  intensities.

- dB may also be used to reference ratio between two amplitudes, but its only
  correct if they're "measured under the same set of conditions"

- **Interesting statistic:** Conversational speech has roughly the same level of
  intensity as pianissimo (pp) loudness in an orchestra

- **Interesting statistic:** Tuning fork waveforms are nearly perfect sinusoids

- A phase comparison of two wave forms is only meaningful if they have harmonic
  frequencies (i.e. the ratio of their frequencies is an exact integer)

- More on this can be read in "Introduction to the Physics and Psychophysics
  of Music" by Juan C. Roederer.
