# 4.12 Synthesis Fundamentals: Compositional Examples

## Mutations I

**Risset on _Mutations I_**
- title refers to gradual transformation throughout the piece
- passage from discontinuous pitch scale to pitch continuum
- transition through "harmonic development" where successive harmonics of the
  notes of a chord come out
- The higher the harmonic order, the finer the pitch step

**Opening passage**
There are three ways that the harmonics of the chord evolve in the opening
passage
1. Each note of the harmonic is played in a stacatto sequence in a non-ascending
   order
2. The same order is repeated but with gradual crescendo on prolonged notes
3. All notes are played at once as a gong sound - individual notes fall off at
   unique times
