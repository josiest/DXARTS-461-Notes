# Notes on various papers written by Jeane-Claude Risset

### Domain of questions to keep in mind for these notes
- What techniques are being described for what pieces of work
- When listening to the music, where are these techniques used?
- What qualities come with these sounds and how can they be further explored?

## Composing Sounds, linking domains
**_Little Boy_ and _Mutations_**

- "prolongate harmony into timbre" and "echo chords into harmony" by
  "tones that sound like their spectral shadow"

- Their sound  material then becomes "highly ductile"

**Musical forms and material**
- *Mutations, Songes* and *Voilements* reflect "drifting forms" and "evolving
  material"

- _Sud, Attracteurs estranges, Invisible, Elementa, Escalas_ reflect forms
  influenced at different levels by a "sonic kernel" or a "morphogentic idea"

### Consequent Questions

**What does it mean for a tone to sound like its spectral shadow?**

**Does that explicitly tie in to describing it as ductile?**

**What is a "morphogenetic idea" and how does it appear in the mentioned
works?**
- Morphogenesis is a biological process that causes a cell, tissue or organism
  to develop its shape

- So morphogenetic idea may be one which develops over the course of a work

## Sculpting Sound with Computers

## Pitch and rhythm paradoxes
